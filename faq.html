                    <h3 class="faq-question">What is Throne?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Throne is a smart device designed to work with your car seat to help prevent the tragic accident of leaving a baby behind in the car. Using advanced iBeacon technology, Throne monitors your proximity to your car seat and sends timely notifications to ensure your baby's safety.</p>

                    <h3 class="faq-question">How does Throne work?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Throne uses iBeacon technology to create a connection between your smartphone and the car seat device. When you walk away from your car with your baby still in the seat, the app detects the distance and sends you an immediate notification to remind you to check your car seat.</p>

                    <h3 class="faq-question">What permissions does Throne need?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Throne requires location permissions to function properly. This allows the app to detect your proximity to the car seat device and send accurate notifications. We only use location data for safety monitoring and never share it with third parties.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How long does it take to receive notifications?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Notification timing can vary based on several factors including your phone's settings, background app refresh, and signal strength. Generally, you should receive notifications within 1-3 minutes of walking away from your car seat. We recommend keeping the app running in the background for optimal performance.</p>
